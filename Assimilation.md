Assimilation is the death of queer people and the homogenization of everything that makes us great. We know love, we know lust, we know pride, we know expression, we know gender. We express, change, manipulate, and mock these things *in spite* of repression, oppression, and evil. We face innumerable obstacles most of which lead to death. We choose to love despite its death sentence. We choose to be unashamed of love in a world which is embiggened and made proud only by death, violence, and cruelty. To be lovers is revolutionary in a world which prioritizes violence.

To assimilate into a society of death would lead to death. To be queer or gay or a faggot or a stud or a tranny in such a world is to choose the valuing of love over death. Our asses will be kicked but we will win.

Heterosexual people do have pride. Their pride exits in killing those who would dare critique them. Their pride exists in conformity. In turning everyone else into the empty, vacuous, machines of capitalism that they so desperately hate being. Homophobia and Transphobia are no longer the right words. It is homo and trans *jealousy* that occurs. They are jealous of others who have the courage to love and unashamedly LIVE. Every queer person who lives unabashedly is a reminder of their own cowardice and shame. That is why they hate on queers who are "too weird" or "not right." They are *jealous* and *furious* at those who can truly live their own beautiful lives.

Every queer person is a shining and beautiful being. A perfectly flawed being. What could be more terrifying, jealousy inducing, and enraging to people who have had their personalities molded and shaped by a culture of death.
Our very existence is a slap to the face of oppression, of death, and of cruelty.

If assimilation is death how can we live? In a world that kills us for being unashamed revolutionary beings. How do we keep going? What really is the key in surviving and thriving to a better time.

What if we all just super cool. What if we all agreed to just be excellent to each other and be super weird wouldn't that be really nice. What about assimilation. How to resist it. Simply existing is an act of defiance and resistance. To begin with we must through every known form of resistance, act against all axis of oppression. For any form of oppression is a shackle that denies us our true humanity. We must fight against racism, sexism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, capitalism, and any other form of oppression. The reason for this is that they cannot co-exist with true expressions of humanity. Capitalism must be included as an axis of oppression. It upholds the rule of private property over the humanity of others. Corporations have more rights that people do.

Can capitalism be queer? **NO** Damn I wish I did more reading so I could make this communist. I don't wanna make not reading a big point here so maybe I just make a short essay on why assimilation is bad what's the alternative to assimilation. What does it look like? Taste like? Feel like? Are there instances? Are there ideas?

Wait let's go in a bit. What does assimilation LOOK like. Can assimilation be willing? Perhaps but not in a complete way. Assimilation done willingly is done out of desperation to hopefully get a lesser punishment. Assimilation is never fully obtainable. Any person who has the ability to assimilate will never get freedom. It's a permanent fake lure. It's a siren's call of a cliff edge. That maybe if you do xyz you'll be distinguished from the others but that's not the case. We are and have always been freaks. We always will be.

1. Assimilation is the death of queer people and the homogenization of everything that makes us great.
2. Heterosexual identity is founded in what they are NOT
     1. Homo/Trans hatred as *jealousy*
     2. Heterosexuals as inauthentic
     3. personalities molded by a culture of death
3. Queerness against oppression
     1. Every form of oppression harms us all.
     2. Capitalism as a form of oppression.
     3. Refusal to create easily controllable workers.
